  * In this module, we explored a technique used to convert raw data from its numeric or categorical format to a format that can be used when performing modeling.

  * Mathematical models mostly "understand" data in numeric form, hence the need for transforming raw data.

  * During the transformation process, features should be normalized as needed to meet the assumptions of the mathematical models.

  * Categorical variables can be transformed to numeric format using feature engineering techniques including categorical variable encoding.

  * Bias can be introduced to the data during the feature engineering process. This bias could be conscious or unconscious. There are different kinds of biases and ways to control for these biases.

  * Principal Component Analysis is the first introduction to modeling. It is a way of using modeling techniques for dimensionality reduction in the dataset.

  * Now that we have completed the data understanding phase, we will transition to modeling.
