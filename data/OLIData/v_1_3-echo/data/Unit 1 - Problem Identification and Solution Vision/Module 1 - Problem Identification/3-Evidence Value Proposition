We use a framework to formulate questions that carefully define business needs
and extract business objectives that can be met using data science techniques.
This framework can help a data science team meet the expectations of the
client, and deliver a solution that meets the business needs. The Evidence
Value Proposition (EVP) framework was developed to help determine the desired
analytic objectives and provide evidence that the objectives can be met with
the appropriate data and technology. This methodology as shown in figure 1
below shows five (5) steps guided by questions that help formulate business
objectives.
