Once a set of business goals has been identified, one can proceed to formulate
analytic objectives that state how the application of analytical methods to
data can facilitate reaching the business goal. An analytic objective can
typically be phrased along the following template:

As an incremental step towards business objective O

We work towards solving problem P

by focusing on specific task T

and applying analytic methods M in conjunction with data D

to create valuable functionality F and/or produce insight I  
  
---  
  
This formulation of an analytic objective can also be considered a research
hypothesis because it effectively posits that a certain technique improves a
metric with regard to a population of problem instances (comparable to a
treatment versus a control condition). In fact, in academic settings, the
effectiveness of data science methods will regularly be scrutinized using
statistical tests and it is good practice to principally strive for similar
methodological rigor in industry applications. While data science teams and
projects in the private sector may use different terminology and specific
technical or other circumstances may differ, this pattern of formulating
analytic objectives is a very good point of departure for framing data science
work and effectively communicating with clients and domain experts. It is the
connecting element between the problem, the technique to be applied, the
associated requirements and evaluation, as well as the business objective.
Also, keep in mind that projects often comprise multiple analytic objectives
that form a larger plan.

In order for you to become proficient in working with this definition, we will
now move to examining its components.
