The data science lifecycle structures the activities of the data science team.
It should not be considered to be linear as there must iterations of
questioning and research involved in each phase. The framework involves input
from various members of the data science team, as well as the client, as
stated below:

  * Business Understanding: Framing objectives and assessing data science readiness. The client and data science team are involved in this step to ensure that the analytic solutions meets the business objectives.

  * Data Acquisition: Involves gathering data from various appropriate sources. Data preparation techniques are employed to ensure the data is useful for analysis. 

  * Modeling: Often mistaken to be the first stage of the process, modeling involves choosing the appropriate model based on the problem (we see why business understanding comes first!). This multi-step process involves feature engineering, algorithm selection, model training and evaluation.

  * Deployment: The model is deployed to an environment for application consumption. Remember that a company needs to measure the impact of the deployed solution to ensure the success of the solution.

The data science lifecycle can seem daunting at first, but a data scientist
will not complete all tasks alone. A productive team consists of various roles
that can ensure the project is successfully executed.
