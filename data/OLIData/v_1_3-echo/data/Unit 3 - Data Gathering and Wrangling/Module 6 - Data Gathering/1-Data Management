A data scientist’s role involves utilizing computational and statistical
skills to uncover solutions that meet business needs. Throughout the process
of discovery and solution development, a data scientist must find it most
useful and efficient to focus on developing algorithms and building the models
that will support the analytic solution for the business need. This unit sheds
light on a crucial phase of the data science project lifecycle that will
inform the solution development.

Previously, you learned about understanding the business by defining a
business problem, setting business and analytic objectives, and gathering
requirements. Going forward, you will learn about the next phase in the data
science project lifecycle, Data Understanding. The data understanding phase
involves data acquisition and data preparation. Data acquisition involves
gathering data from different sources and transforming the data into formats
that are suitable for analytic solution development. As a data scientist, you
will spend more than 70% of your time understanding, exploring, and
transforming the data used for model building. This is important because the
quality of your data has a direct impact on the quality of your analytic
solution. Through your readings and discussions outside of this course, you
will hear data professionals say "Garbage Data In-Garbage Decisions Out". You
want to pay close attention to the data that is used to develop your analytic
solution.

Data Gathering Overview

Now that the requirements phase is completed, the data science team will
embark on data acquisition or data gathering. In this unit, we will describe
the data gathering process to include data management considerations and its
implications on the quality of data, data collection processes and tools, and
the data wrangling pipeline. Although the data science project team might not
be able to control the data management operations of their data sources,
understanding the principles of data management will assist the team in
gathering data that is reliable, valid, and has integrity. Even the most
secure and reliable data needs to be transformed into a format that can be
used to develop analytic solutions. This transformation process happens in
various stages of the data gathering and processing phase. A popular term that
is referenced in the data transformation process is Data Wrangling. This is
the process of gathering, selecting, and transforming data to ensure that it
is usable, free of noise and has as little bias as possible to meet defined
analytic objectives. This process will include checking for missing values,
identifying outliers, and formatting the data.

Once the data is “wrangled”, the data science project team will continue to
work with the data until it is ready to be used.

Useful Skill: Prior to using APIs and web scraping tools to pull data from
different sources. It is important to learn about the importance of quality
data and how it can help you meet business and analytic objectives.

Data Management

You might be wondering if it is not enough to begin working on that analytic
solution now that you have defined your objectives. Now that the project team
has defined a data statement, set analytic objectives and gathered
requirements. What more do you need to do to start modeling!

Prematurely moving past the data understanding phase will result in bad
results for your client. If your team does not understand data quality and how
it affects your solution, your solution will be incomplete. Data management
supports the data science process by making sure that the data housed within
an organization is accessible and accurate. Data management is a strategic
initiative, it is an organization’s way of acquiring, storing, securing and
processing data.

The data management structure is managed by the IT team in an organization.
However, business users will participate in this initiative as well. Data
management is such an important aspect of a business that over 100 data
management practitioners compiled a best practices framework to guide
organizations on managing their data and information infrastructure. The data
management body of knowledge (DAMA-DMBOK) highlights eleven knowledge areas as
shown in the figure below. These knowledge areas are instrumental to the
success of an organization’s data infrastructure.

The Eleven Knowledge Areas of Data Management

Referencing the figure above, you will note that there are different skill
sets and departments involved in the data management process. The data
management process is not entirely a data science task.It is a data
infrastructure task. Data management informs the data gathering process and
can influence the implementation of analytic solutions. The data architects in
an organization are responsible for designing the organization's data
management framework. This framework will assist the data science team and
other data stakeholders in the organization to use data based on defined
policies and regulations to meet business and analytic objectives.
