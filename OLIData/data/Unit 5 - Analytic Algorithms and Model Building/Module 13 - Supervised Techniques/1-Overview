When a model is trained on data that is labelled, it is learning from past
experiences that allow it to perform a task when introduced to new unlabeled
data. The labeled data is considered previous knowledge that has both input
and output parameters. This method of training a model is called Supervised
Learning. DeepAI has a concise definition of supervised learning, it is
defined as "A class of systems and algorithms that determine a predictive
model using data points with known outcomes."

Supervised Learning tasks can be used for Classification and Regression tasks.
Both tasks use algorithms to train the models. We will explore in the next
pages and onwards.

We have covered techniques should as Linear and Logistic Regression, we will
explore some popular techniques including k-Nearest Neighbors, Tree Methods,
and naive Bayes. As you continue your journey in the MCDS program especially
in the Machine Learning course, you will explore supervised learning tasks
outside of the well known algorithms introduced in this course.
