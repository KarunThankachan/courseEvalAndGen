  * The difference between a traditional IT project and a Data Science project is the focus on the analytical data, model, and operations requirements.

  * Requirements are capabilities needed to achieve an objective. Requirements are gathered from stakeholders of a project including the client, end users, and the data science team. Good requirements are correct, complete, unambiguous, verifiable, measurable, and traceable.

  * Requirements analysis involves activities that identify business needs, evaluate feasibility of solution, and establish constraints.

  * Requirements management is an iterative set of activities to help ensure that elicitation, documentation, refinement and changes of requirements is done during the data science project life cycle.

  * Requirements gathering involves fact-finding that describes the current state of the business, and the business objectives that inform the proposed solution. Requirements gathering is done to ensure that business needs, and solutions are well defined. 

  * There are three types of requirements highlighted in this unit. The business, system and user, and solution requirements.
