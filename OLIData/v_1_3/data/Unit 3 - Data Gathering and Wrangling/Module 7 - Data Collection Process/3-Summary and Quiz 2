Each data science project is unique and will require a data collection
technique that suits the problem and objectives it seeks to meet. The data
collection techniques for a sentiment analysis project analyzing social media
tweets will differ from the techniques of an image classification project for
patient diagnosis. When you defined the project's business and analytic
objectives, the tasks and methods were proposed as well, those tasks and
methods drive the type of data that will be used in the project. The type of
data will influence the source and data collection techniques.

This module described the traditional techniques for data collection. Those
techniques include conducting interviews, focus groups, document analysis, and
observations. There are various types of data and this affects the method
employed to solve your analytic objective.

A data scientist should also know the different sources of data and how it
affects the solution development process. There is data that is sourced by
your client but controlled by an external source and data that is collected
and owned by your client.
