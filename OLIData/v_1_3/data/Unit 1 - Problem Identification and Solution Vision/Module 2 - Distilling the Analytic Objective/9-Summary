  * This module focused on formulating the analytic objective, which is also considered a research hypothesis because it effectively posits that a certain technique improves a metric with regard to a population of problem instances.

  * A well framed analytic objective will include the following elements:

    * Understanding the business objective

    * Identifying the problem

    * Focusing on a well defined task

    * Checking proposed method against the target insight

    * Proposing data collection and curation methods

    * Framing the analytic objective

  * Analytic objectives can be reframed to focus on specific tasks, in which case an incremental step would become the main goal. 

An analytic objective should state (1) what specific functionality, insight,
or resource is gained from leveraging that data and methods you propose (2)
relative to the current situation, and (3) assuming the project is successful
as proposed.
